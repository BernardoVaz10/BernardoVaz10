# Hi there, here you will get the opportunity to know me a little bit better! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Bernardo, and I am a finalist student of Informatic Engineering at Instituto PolitÃ©cnico of SetÃºbal. I am a person that's very communicative and I like to view myself as a social and interactive person. I strive to be good at what I do, which drives me to learn more, improve myself, and a desire to become a reference for others for good reasons. I believe that with time and experience, I will achieve that.

Since I was a kid, I always had a strong passion for football and technology. I enjoy working in challenging projects that allow me to apply my skills and learn new ones. My goal is to become a proficient software engineer who can contribute to innovative projects and make a positive impact in the tech industry.

Right now the areas in which I am most interested in are Web Development and Cybersecurity. I am currently taking courses in these areas to improve my skills and knowledge. I am also working on personal projects (like the OffSchoolProject down below on "Projects" ) to apply what I have learned and gain practical experience.

In addition to my technical skills, I value teamwork and collaboration. I believe that working with others and sharing knowledge is essential for personal and professional growth. I am always open to new opportunities and experiences that can help me grow as an individual and as a professional.
